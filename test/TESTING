Running Tests
================================================================================

You must have the source distribution (from git) to run the tests properly. This
is something I plan to remedy in 0.6.0.

You need the 'test-unit' gem to get started...

    gem install test-unit

There are three rake targets, run from the root of the source.

    test_dbi: these are interface tests and do not require database connectivity.
    test_dbd: these are database-specific tests. Read DBD_TESTS.
    test: runs the both test_dbi and test_dbd
