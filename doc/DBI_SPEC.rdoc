= DBI Interface Spec, for version 0.4.0

by Erik Hollensbe <erik@hollensbe.org>

== Foreword

DBI is still in a large state of flux. Previous versions of this
specification rarely reflected reality, and the 0.4.0 release is an
attempt to get the code and documentation more in sync.

While this is the goal, there is still a lot of
code to check, sanitize, and otherwise clean up. If you find something
missing in these specifications while working on a new DBD or a patch
for DBI, please bring it to our attention (in IRC or on the mailing list)
to get the spec revised. Doing this will save
yourself (and the DBI authors) a lot of time.

== Design

With DBI, there are the concepts of driver, database, and statement. The core
functionality for these concepts is provided by a database driver, or
DBD.  DBI controls one or more drivers at once, a driver has databases, a
database may have statements.

DBI uses a delegation model to communicate with its DBDs through a
series of handles.  When a connection to a database is requested, DBI contacts
the appropriate DBD and builds a handle in
its name that it aligns with a DBI base class for that concept. The
handle provided by the DBD is the first-class method of communication,
otherwise it resorts to calling the base class methods.  This allows
DBI to provide a level of consistency unless the DBD author finds it
otherwise unnecessary.

For example: DBI will provide handy methods like fetch_all and
fetch_scroll which all leverage the fetch method in the base class,
and the fetch method must be implemented by the DBD. However, the DBD
may have an internal representation of fetch_scroll (as is the case
with the ODBC driver) that may be more suited to direct use, and
therefore DBI will never see the base class method. This is similar to
inheritance, but there is a distinct disconnect between the handles
and the base classes, intentionally so. This way the DBDs have no
access to the base class and DBI does all the delegation work. Also,
DBI has no idea what the DBD is doing underneath, nor does it need to
care as long as valid data is returned.

== Classes

These are the classes that make up the core of DBI and provide
various functionality:

=== DBI
Core module, responsible for everything underneath it, kickstarting
connections and loading drivers.

=== DBI::Row

Responsible for representing the result set and managing the type
conversion of the result set. 

=== DBI::Utils

Utility methods which propogate through the rest of DBI.

=== DBI::SQL

Utility methods for working with SQL queries. Includes a
driver-independent SQL bind manager.

=== DBI::ColumnInfo

Responsible for representing the information per column for both
queries and table descriptions.

=== DBI::Type

Namespace for typecasting classes. These classes are provided with a
parse method which converts them to a native Ruby type from a string.

=== DBI::TypeUtil

The inverse of DBI::Type, this provides functionality to turn native
Ruby types into a representation suitable for the DBD's queries.

=== DBI::Binary

The representation of a BLOB/CLOB in a Ruby object. This will
eventually be rolled into DBI::Type::, but remains here currently for
compatibility purposes.

=== DBI::Base* and DBI::*Handle

Please see the Design section above for the description of these modules.

== Exceptions

DBI has a slew of custom exceptions it uses to control program flow,
and alert the user to specific classes of problems.

They currently all live in the DBI namespace, although it's expected
that there will eventually be an exception namespace.

=== DBI::Warning < RuntimeError
    For important warnings such as data truncation, etc.

=== DBI::Error < RuntimeError
    Base class of all other error exceptions.
    Rescue this to rescue all DBI errors.

=== DBI::InterfaceError < DBI::Error
    Exception for errors related to the DBI interface rather 
    than the database itself.

=== DBI::NotImplementedError < DBI::InterfaceError
    Exception raised if the DBD driver has not specified
    a mandatory method.

=== DBI::DatabaseError < DBI::Error
    Exception for errors related to the database.
 
    Has three attributes: ((|err|)), ((|errstr|)) and ((|state|)).

=== DBI::DataError < DBI::DatabaseError
    Exception for errors due to problems with the processed 
    data, such as division by zero, numeric value out of range, etc.

=== DBI::OperationalError < DBI::DatabaseError
    Exception for errors related to the database's operation which
    are not necessarily under the control of the programmer.  This would include
    such things as unexpected disconnection, failure to find a datasource name,
    failure to process a transaction, memory allocation errors, etc.

=== DBI::IntegrityError < DBI::DatabaseError
    Exception raised when the relational integrity of the database
    is affected, such as when a foreign key constraint is violated.

=== DBI::InternalError < DBI::DatabaseError
    Exception raised when the database encounters an internal error, 
    such as a cursor not being valid anymore, or a transaction going out of
    sync.

=== DBI::ProgrammingError < DBI::DatabaseError
    Exception raised for programming errors, e.g., table not found
    or already exists, syntax error in SQL statement, wrong number
    of parameters specified, etc.

=== DBI::NotSupportedError < DBI::DatabaseError
    Raised if, e.g., ((<commit>)) is called for a database that does not
    support transactions.

== API

To save my sanity, I have joined the specification and the rdoc for
DBI. Please review the specification there.

If you wish to author your own DBD, please see DBD_SPEC.rdoc,
which is a more in-depth view of the communication between DBI and
DBDs.
